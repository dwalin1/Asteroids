<h1>Asteroids</h1>

An Asteroids game playable in the browser, written in object-oriented Javascript with surrogate-based inheritance. When I first wrote this, it was an excellent lesson in some of the ways Javascript differs from Ruby.

For instance, in Ruby we tend to implement games inside a while or until loop. Until the game is over, or while playing, or whatever, we continue to loop, and each pass through the loop is a turn in the game. That kind of structure is not useful in Javascript because of its reliance on asynchronous callbacks. Instead, I use JavaScript's setInterval method, which gets passed a callback to a "step" function and a number of milliseconds dependent on a framerate constant. Thirty times per second (or whatever we set the framerate constant to) the step function is called, and it in turn makes calls to move the asteroids, ship, and bullets, blank out and redraw the screen, detect collisions and act on them, including breaking the asteroids into smaller asteroids, etc. Likewise, setTimeOut works with a callback to establish a three-second period of invincibility after the player has collided with an asteroid and lost a life, and similarly to cause bullets to expire after a set period.
